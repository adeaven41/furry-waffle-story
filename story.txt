There was a black cat named Zeus. Zeus was an elderly cat, which you would 
not know based on anything but his size. He was often found high above the 
ground, contently resting on a treebranch - or riding a window screen
from one of the second floor windows in his house to the wonderous outdoor
ground below. Zeus was not shy in the least, and always made his presence
known. His acre yard was his home, the squirrels his minions, and the dirt in
which he rolled his pleasure.

Zeus had a friend. Zeus' friend's name was Edroj. Edroj likes linux and Apple; 
he is that guy. His friend one day came over to him and asked Zeus how he got his 
name. Zeus replied:

When my owners picked me up, it was during the worst storm they had ever seen.
The winds were swirling, the amount of rain was unworldly, and most of all 
the thunder was earthshaking. They only assumed that the storm could only
be the work of the god of thunder..Zeus. They saw I wasn't scared of the storm,
but rather found the sounds of the wind and thunder soothing. They saw this and 
decided that I should be called Zeus.
